# Unit 2
Python Conditionals and basic Datatypes


## Description
```
CONTROL STATEMENTS: Control Flow and Syntax - Indenting - if Statement - statements and
expressions- string operations- Boolean Expressions -while Loop - break and continue - for Loop.
LISTS: List-list slices - list methods - list loop – mutability – alilisasing - cloning lists - list
parameters. TUPLES: Tuple assignment, tuple as return value -Sets – Dictionaries
```

## Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.


## Contol statements

Contol statement in a programming language is used to run the program conditionally meaning that conditional statementa allow the certain block of code based on some conditions 
The python programming language support the following conditional statements
1. if statement
2. if elif
3. if else


## Looping 
Looping statement allow us to run a block of code for a specific number of times
python supports following looping statements

1. for loop
2. while loop

## List 
List is a Dynamic Data structure in python which is used to store a list of values it is similar to arrays in other programming languages 

but the difffernce is list may contian different data types

 refer
 unit-2/3.list.py file


 ## Tuples
 Tuples are also similar to list but the difference is that the tuple is immutale meaning the contents of the tuple cannot be modified after created
 And also tuple supports less methods commpared to python lists

 refer unit-2/4.tuple.py


 ## Dictionary 
 Dictionary is Advanced data type in python programming language which is used to store the data in Key value pair data structure


 The advantage with dictionaries is you can access the values using the keys and it provides a way for implementing hashmaps
